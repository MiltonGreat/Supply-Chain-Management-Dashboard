# Supply Chain Efficiency Analysis Dashboard

### Overview

This project focuses on analyzing supply chain efficiency, identifying bottlenecks, and recommending strategies for optimization. The primary goal is to create a data-driven dashboard using Power BI to visualize key metrics such as inventory levels, supplier performance, and delivery times.

### Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing supply chain information, including inventory levels, supplier performance metrics, and delivery times. The processed data is prepared using Python, and visualizations are created in Power BI to uncover actionable insights for supply chain management.

### Project Workflow

- Data Extraction: Extracted and loaded data from Supply Chain Analysis.zip.
- Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and ensured consistency in data formatting.
- Feature Engineering: Calculated supplier performance metrics, grouped inventory data, and analyzed delivery times.
- Data Export: Saved processed data to CSV files for use in Power BI.
- Dashboard Creation: Imported processed CSV files into Power BI to create interactive visualizations and reports.

### Power BI Dashboard Features:

- Interactive Visualizations: Clustered bar charts, stacked column charts, and box plots.
- Filters and Slicers: Filter data by supplier, product type, or time period for detailed analysis.
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Cards to display high-level metrics like total costs, total revenue, and average lead times.

### Key Insights

- Inventory Management: Identified trends in stock levels and order quantities across suppliers and product types.
- Supplier Analysis: Highlighted top-performing suppliers based on defect rates, lead times, and revenue generation.
- Delivery Time Variability: Revealed inconsistencies in delivery times, suggesting areas for process improvement.

  ### Future Enhancements

- Incorporate predictive modeling to forecast supply chain metrics like inventory levels or lead times.
- Use time-series analysis for seasonal trends in supply chain performance.
- Add a Power BI paginated report for detailed data exports.
